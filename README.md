# Lunar Assistant App

This repo contains the lunar assistant front and backend. The main functionality is to:
- Provide a frontend from which a user can sign a transaction to be sent to the backend which proves ownership of a particular wallet.
- A backend which receives transactions, verifies them, and updates the database to reflect the relationship between the discord user and wallet address. 

Currently the frontend is deployed with vercel at: https://lunar-assistant.vercel.app/
## Setup
